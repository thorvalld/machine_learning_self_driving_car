# Self driving car
a self driving car built with Python using Neural Networks, Deep Q Learning, Pytorch &amp; Kivy.

**Guide**

1- Run the **map.py** file.

2- Let the car discover its environment a little it should learn how to drive from top left corner to bottom right corner.

3- Once it do that hit save.

4- Hold and drag left button mouse to start drawing your map/roads: drag slow to draw thick walls and drag fast to draw thinner walls (the faster you drag the thinner the wall will be)

5- Hit load to load the neural network to the car's brain.

6- Watch the car discover the environment and learn to drive. 



PS: you can close the program and go back later and just hit "load" to use the last saved neural network.
